# Aptos Move Smart Contract - Simple Voting

## 📖 Description
This project is a **simple smart contract written in Move for the Aptos blockchain**.  
It allows users to create proposals and vote on them, demonstrating how decentralized voting can be implemented using Aptos smart contracts.  

The contract is minimal, easy to understand, and serves as a starting point for developers exploring Move.

## 🌍 Vision
The vision of this project is to provide a **lightweight, transparent, and secure voting mechanism** on the blockchain.  
It can be extended for community decisions, DAO governance, or any on-chain poll system where fairness and immutability are crucial.  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add support for multiple proposals instead of one.  
- Allow voters to withdraw or update their votes.  
- Introduce weighted voting (based on tokens).  
- Add an end date/time for proposals.  
- Build a frontend dApp for easy interaction with the contract.
